Auto generate body of Steam workshop content pages


## Description

I created this project to help me keep my Steam workshop content up to date.
Any time a file is out of date, it will be rebuilt automatically.

The implementation is decent, but there is certainly room for improvement.  Feel free to suggest revisions.


## Under Construction

TODO:

* Open up browser to workshop page each time a file is regenerated
* Copy the new text to the clipboard
* Give the user the path to the pictures that go with the file if those are out of date


## Details

### cfg

* links.json - contains attributions to other items on the workshop
